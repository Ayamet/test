However, pronunciation differs significantly. The alphabet is: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z. Most letters are pronounced consistently, unlike English. Example: 'A' is always pronounced 'ah' as in 'father', never as in 'cake'. Cultural note: Indonesian doesn't use complex characters like Chinese or Arabic, which makes it more accessible for beginners."

Examples: 'apa' (what) = ah-pah, 'enak' (delicious) = uh-nak, 'itu' (that) = ee-too. Pronunciation tip: The letter E is the most challenging as it can sound like 'eh' or 'uh' depending on the word."

Examples: 'cari' (look for) = chah-ree, 'gula' (sugar) = goo-lah, 'roti' (bread) = roh-tee (rolled R), 'khas' (typical) = khas.

Cultural note: Indonesian pronunciation is very phonetic - words are pronounced exactly as they're spelled.
